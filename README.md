# Wiki-Grapher


This project aims at creating a network of topics created by wikipedia api "related" pages.
You can find it in wikipedia list of available apis.

The version 1 will sequentially select names.  
The version 2 will randomise the selection.

Then using matplotlib we will provide a live graph like a movie or just a fgraph exported to pdf.

Hope you will like it.

Thanks
